# Introduction to mOTUs

mOTUs uses 10 of the 40 universal marker genes to taxonomically profile metagenomes, to quantify metabolically active members in metatranscriptomics and to quantify differences between strain populations using single nucleotide variation (SNV) profiles.

Today we will show how to use the tool for the first and second of these tasks, profiling metagenomes and metatranscriptomes.

The most basic command is ***profile***, which runs the entire mOTUs pipeline with default parameters.
